    <h3>1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h3>
         <p>No,They are not the same thing,HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element.
         HTML element holds the content. <br>Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements.
         </p>
   
    <h3>2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h3>
         <p><b>Tags:</b>HTML tag starts with < and ends with > Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements. <br>
         <b>Attributes:</b>HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail. 
        </p>

    <h3>3. What are void elements in HTML? With Example</h3>
         <p><b>Void elements</b>, also known as <b>self-closing elements </b> or <b>empty elements</b>, are HTML elements that do not have 
            a closing tag <br> because they cannot contain any content between an opening and closing tag. These elements are
            used to insert various types of standalone <br>content, such as images, line breaks, and input fields, into an HTML document. <br>
            <b>Example:</b><br>
            <ul>
            <li><b>&lt;br&gt;</b>is used to break line </li>
            <li><b>&lt;hr&gt;</b>is used for Horizontal line </li>
            <li><b>&lt;input&gt;</b>is used within < form> element to declare input controls that allow users to input data. </li>
            <li><b>&lt;Img&gt;</b> is used to embed Image in the HTML page. <br> <img style="height: 100px; width:100px; border-image: auto;" src="Delhi.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><b>&lt;link&gt;</b> is used to link External Resources.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
           
    <h3>4. What are HTML Entities? With Example.</h3>

        <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML,<br>
        such as reserved characters like <, >, &, and non-ASCII characters that can't be represented directly 
        in HTML.<br> HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). They allow you to <br>
        display these characters correctly in a web page without interfering with the HTML structure.<br>
        <b>Example:</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li> ampersand(&)lt; represents &lt;</li>
            <li> ampersand(&)gt; represents &gt;</li>
            <li> ampersand(&)amp; represents &amp;</li>
            <li> ampersand(&)quot; represents &quot;</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    <h3>5. What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h3>
        <p>In HTML, you can create different types of lists to structure and organize content. <br>
            There are three main types of lists: ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists. <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Ordered Lists (&lt;ol&gt;):</b> lists are used when you want to list items in 
                    a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>First Item</li>
                    <li>Second Item</li>
                    <li>Third Item</li>
                </ol><br>
                <li><b>Unordered Lists(&lt;ul&gt;):</b> Bullets or other symbols are typically used to mark each list item.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>First</li>
                    <li>Second</li>
                    <li>Third</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li><b>Description Lists(&lt;dl&gt;):</b> lists are used to display terms and their corresponding descriptions.</li>

         </p>

    <h3>6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.</h3>   
        <p>In HTML, the class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. 
        Classes are used to define <br> a set of styles or behaviors that can be applied to one or more elements on a web page.
        This attribute allows you to target <br> specific elements for styling using CSS or to apply JavaScript behavior to those elements.</p>
        <style>
            .blue {
                  color: blue;
                }

            .bold {
                  font-weight: bold;
                }
        </style>
        <p class="blue">This text is blue.</p>
        <p class="bold">This text is bold.</p>
        <p class="blue bold">This text is blue and bold.</p>
    
    <h3>7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? With Example.</h3>     
       <p><table border="">
            <tr>
                <th>ID Attribute</th>
                <th>CLASS Attribute</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 50%;"><b>1.</b>The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element on a page. <br>
                    <b>2.</b>It must be unique within the entire HTML document, meaning no two elements should share the same id value. <br>
                    <b>3.</b>This makes it suitable for targeting specific elements using CSS or JavaScript. <br>
                    <b>4.</b>IDs are often used when you want to apply specific styles or behavior to a single element. <br>
                    <style>
                        #paragraph {
                                   font-weight: bold;
                                   color: blue;
                                }

                    </style>
                    <p id="paragraph">This is a unique paragraph.</p>
                    </td>
                <td style="width: 50%;">
                    <b>1.</b>The class attribute is used to identify 
                    one or more elements as part of a group that shares a common style or behavior. <br>
                    <b>2.</b>Multiple elements can have the same class,
                     and a single element can have multiple classes (separated by spaces). <br>
                    <b>3.</b>This allows you to apply CSS styles or JavaScript behavior to multiple elements at once. <br>
                    <style>
                        .pink-paragraph {
                                        background-color:pink;
                                        border: 1px solid black;

                    <p class="pink-paragraph">This paragraph is also highlighted.</p>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
       </p>
       
    <h3>8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Formatting tags in HTML are used to define the appearance and structure
            of text and content within a web page. <br>Here are some of the commonly used formatting tags in HTML:
        <ol>
            <li><b>&lt;b&gt;:</b>Represents bold text. <br>This is an Example Of <b>Bold Tag</b></li><br>
            <li><b>&lt;i&gt;</b>Represents italicized text. <br>This is an Example Of <i>Italic  Tag</i></li><br>

            <li><b>&lt;sub&gt;</b>Represents subscript text. <br>H<sub>2</sub>O  => Subscripted Tag </li><br>
            <li><b>&lt;sup&gt;</b> Represents superscript text. <br>4<sup>2</sup>  => Superscripted Tag </li><br>
            <li><b>&lt;mark&gt;</b>Represents text that should be highlighted or marked. <br>This is an Example Of <mark>Mark  Tag</mark></li>
        </ol></p>   

    <h3>9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h3>
        <p><b>&bull;Cell Padding:</b> Cell padding refers to the space between the content of a cell and its border.
           It defines how much space is added between the content (text, images, etc.) inside a table cell and the cell's border.</p>
    
        <table border="" cellpadding="20">
        <tr>
          <td>Cell with padding</td>
          <td>Another cell with padding</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p><b>&bull;Cell Spacing:</b> Cell spacing, on the other hand, refers to the space between adjacent cells within the table.
        It controls the gap between the borders of neighboring cells.</p> 
        <table border="" cellspacing="10">
            <tr>
              <td>Cell 1</td>
              <td>Cell 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Cell 3</td>
              <td>Cell 4</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
           
    <h3>10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
        table? With Example.</h3> 
        <p>In HTML tables, you can use the <b>rowspan</b> and <b>colspan</b> attributes to merge multiple adjacent rows <br>
             or columns into a single row or column, respectively. This can be useful for creating tables with cells that span <br>
             across multiple rows or columns. Here's an example of <b>rowspan</b> and <b>colspan</b> :    
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                  <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
                  <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
                  <td rowspan="2">Merged Row 1-2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
                  <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td colspan="2">Merged Column 1-2</td>
                  <td>Row 3, Column 3</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>

    <h3>11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h3>     
        <p>In HTML and CSS, elements are classified as either <b>block-level</b> or <b>inline</b> elements, and this classification affects <br>
        how the elements are displayed and how they interact with other elements on a web page. <br>
         Here's the difference between block-level and inline elements: <br>
         <b>Block-Level Elements:</b> <br>
        &bull;Block-level elements create a "block" on the web page, meaning they take up the entire width of their containing element by default. <br>
        &bull;They start on a new line and stack vertically on top of each other. <br>
        &bull;You can control their dimensions using width and height properties. <br>
        Examples of block-level elements include &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;table&gt; and more. <br>
        <b>Inline Elements:</b><br>
        &bull;Inline elements do not create a new block or line break. They flow within the content and only take up as much width as necessary. <br>
        &bull;They do not start on a new line and are displayed next to each other as long as there is enough space. <br>
        &bull;Inline elements cannot have width and height applied to them. <br>
        Examples of inline elements include &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and more.</p>

    <h3>12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.</h3>     
        <p>To create a hyperlink in HTML, you use the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element. The anchor element allows you to link to another webpage, <br>
        a file, an email address, or another resource on the web. <br>
        <b>Syntax:</b><br>
        &lt;a href="URL"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt; <br>
        <b>Example:</b>This is a Link-<br>
        <a style="font-size: 40px;" href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a><br>
        In this example, "Visit Google" will be displayed as a clickable link. When a user clicks on it, they will be directed to the Google homepage.</p>

    <h3>13. What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.</h3>
        <p>The &lt;iframe&gt; (inline frame) HTML tag is used to embed another HTML document or webpage within the current document. 
        It's often <br> used to display content from another source while keeping it isolated from the rest of the page's layout and styles. 
        This is <br> commonly used for embedding videos, maps, advertisements, or other external content. <br>

        Here's an example of &lt;iframe&gt; tag: <br>
    <p>Below is an embedded Google Map using an iframe:</p>
    
   <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3671.9393827265217!2d72.55701909999999!3d23.

   referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
        </p>     
        
    <h3>14. What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h3>
        <p>The &lt;span&gt; tag in HTML is an inline element that is used to apply styles, classes, or other attributes 
            to a specific portion of text <br> or content within a larger block of text. <br>
            <style>
                .highlight {
                    background-color: yellow;
                    font-weight: bold;
                }
            </style>
            <b>Syntax:</b>
            &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;span class="highlight"&gt; highlighted &lt;/span&gt; word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
            <p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> word in a sentence.</p></p>
    
    <h3>15. How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.</h3>
        <p>To insert a picture into the background image of a web page, you can use CSS to set the background image and overlay <br>
        it with content, including images. Here's an example </p>
    <a href="BackgroundImage.html"><big>BackgroundImage Example</big></a>

    <h3>16. How are active links different from normal links?</h3>   
        <p>Those that don't have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link. <br>
            If you left or right-click any one of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. 
            Active Links shows that the <br> browser is in the process to load a new resource. </p>

    <h3>17. What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h3>  
        <p>In HTML, there are various tags that you can use to separate and structure sections of text. <br>
            Here are some commonly used tags for this purpose: <br>

        <b>&bull;&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt;,&lt;h4&gt;,&lt;h5&gt;,&lt;h6&gt;:</b>They are used to define the Headings of different levels. <br>
        <b>&bull;&lt;p&gt;:</b> Paragraph tag. This is used to enclose and indicate separate paragraphs of text. <br>
        <b>&bull;&lt;section&gt;:</b> Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with its own heading or title. <br>
        <b>&bull;&lt;article&gt;:</b> Represents a self-contained composition, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post. <br>
        <b>&bull;&lt;blockquote&gt;:</b>Indicates a block of quoted content. <br>
        <b>&bull;&lt;pre&gt;:</b>Preformatted text. It preserves whitespace and line breaks as they appear in the source code. <br>
        </p> 

    <h3>18. What is SVG?</h3>
        <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a unique type of image format for vector-based <br>
        graphics written in Extensible Markup Language (XML).SVG is commonly used for a wide range of applications, including icons, <br>
        logos, illustrations, data visualizations, maps, and more. It's supported by most modern web browsers, making it a <br>
        versatile choice for web development.</p> 

    <h3>19. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3>   
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to structure <br>
        content on the web, but there are some key differences between the two: <br>

    <h3>20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h3>   
        <p>Logical tags are used to tell the browser what kind of text is written inside the tags. 
        They are different from physical tags because physical tags are used to decide the appearance of the text and 
        do not provide any information about the text.</p>
